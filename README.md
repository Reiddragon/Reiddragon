# Hallo!
You've just stumbled upon the page of @Reiddragon, a Linux nerd who loves
starting projects then never finishing them

3rd person speech aside, I'm a Linux nerd and student, mostly interested in doing wacky stuff no one in their right mind would do

## btw I use
- Arch (ofc)
- [Vim](https://github.com/Reiddragon/vimrc/)
- KDE Plasma
- sometimes [Sway](https://github.com/Reiddragon/sway.conf/)

## Langs I know
- Python
- Hy
- C (and some very basic C++)
- (some) Bash scripting
- Pascal

## Langs I want to learn
- Chicken Scheme

## Projects I'm proud of
- [ips-patcher.hy](https://github.com/Reiddragon/ips-patcher.hy) - an IPS
  patcher I wrote in Hy because I really wanted to play some ROM hacks and
  couldn't find any good patchers that run on Linux
